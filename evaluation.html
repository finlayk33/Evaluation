<h3> Question: <br> What were the biggest challenges you encountered during these projects, and how did you overcome them?
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer: <br> The biggest challenges I encountered during these projects were definitely the most technical parts of each assessment. <br> <br> For the recipe early in the year, I found it quite a challenge to get specific elements in specific places on my website like the omelette image. I overcame this by watching YouTube tutorials and information from various websites online. <br> <br> For the animation, I found it quite difficult to get the easing parts of the animation done. I overcame this by using information from anime.js which helped me incorporate easings into the animation. <br> <br> Finally, for the dungeon project, I found it challenging trying to model some of the items inside of the dungeon. I overcame this by watching lots of YouTube tutorials and also searching up modelling tutorials on Google.

    Question: <br> What specific skills or knowledge did you develop throughout the process?
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer: <br> I developed a huge range of different skills and knowledge throughout the process of all of the assessments this year.
    <br>
    <br>
    From the recipe project, I developed the skills and knowledge on how to replicate a website, add elements to a website, and design my own functional website using HTML and CSS.
    <br>
    <br>
    From the animation project, I developed the skills and knowledge on how to incorporate easings into an animation, how to create a unique SVG, and how to actually animate the SVG from scratch.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lastly, from the dungeon project I developed the skills and knowledge on how to create low-poly but realistic models in Blender, how to efficiently texture models in Blender, how to animate model characters and cameras in Blender, and how to render out the fully textured and modelled animation from Blender.
